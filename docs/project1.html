          The global demand for metal 3D printing (additive manufacturing) has been increasingly prevalent, especially in a spectrum of high-temperature engineering applications, due to the ability to facilitate the manufacture of complicated concept designs that were not possible with traditional manufacturing techniques. Manufacturers have recognised that metal 3D printed parts are failing to meet structural rigidity certification requirements due to the stochastic events that take place during manufacture.
          <br>
          This project investigates the cooling rates in Laser Powder Bed Fusion (L-PBF) by analysing the data collected from coaxial high-speed cameras at different wavelengths. The aim is to identify any correlation between the cooling rates and the formation of defects in the printed parts. To visualise irregularities on the layer below, a temperature integration method was explored. This method is preferred as it helps to mitigate the presence of noise in the collected data, thus enabling more accurate identification of anomalies.

          Prior to carrying out temperature analysis on the melt pool, the raw images captured were pre-processed to improve the accuracy and reliability of the results. Pre-processing methods include image alignment, image rotation, image denoise and temperature measurement.

        <p class="project-overview-text">
          One of the reasons why temperature analysis is carried out is to impose a physical parameter onto to the raw images captured. This is because the high speed cameras captures emissivity of the melt pool, which does not directly correlate to the amount thermal radiation emitted. In some cases, a cold object might have a high emissivity, resulting in a brighter light captured and vice versa.
          <br>
          Previous studies on melt pool temperature and temperature derivatives were generally limited by the short camera exposure times, occasionally resulting in insufficient data transfer and low dynamic range - defined by the ratio between the brightest and darkest parts of the image.
          <br>
          In order to plot the temperature-time history for a pixel and for all pixels in 2D, a temperature summation method was adopted.

          As part of this project, two temperature analysis methodologies were developed to establish a relarelationship
          between thermal emission measurements and defect formation in additive manufacturing. Firstly, a temperature summation method was adopted across the build to visualise the temperature
          difference between defect areas and non-defect areas. This method increases the signal-to-noise
          ratio, intensifying favourable signal while concealing undesired noise. Contrary to previous studies,
          lower thermal emissions were recorded at the seeded defect locations in comparison to the rest of the
          build. This is due to instabilities in the melt pool which results in a higher heat dissipation through
          larger spatter particles as well as the scanning laser penetrating deeper into the cavity causing excess
          metal powder to conceal the emissivity of the melt pool. Subsequently, the temperatures across the
          whole build was aggregated to allow the rate of change of temperature at each pixel to be measured
          - defined as the rate of solidification of the melted metal powder. No clear distinction between defect
          and non-defect locations were found using the temperature derivative values as it was acknowledged
          that the method of calculating temperatures introduced large amount of undesired noise. 
          <br>
          Nevertheless,
          carrying out the methodologies developed in this project on the raw images acquired found
          promising anomalies at defect locations. Although emissivity does not directly correlate to temperature,
          a pixel intensity summation map is a faster and more efficient way to resolve approximate
          defect locations in comparison to CT scans. The average rate of change of pixel intensity across
          the build was -2.164, while lower values of -1.65 Â± 0.10 were recorded at defect locations, which
          indicates increased heat accumulation and slower cooling rates at the presence of defect cavities.
          In conclusion, this research project was unsuccessful in directly relating temperature measurements
          to defect formation in additive manufacturing. Despite that, valuable temperature measurement insights were displayed, serving as a good baseline for further improvement in the analysis.
